A Discord Music Bot built in Java using JDA and LavaPlayer<br><br>
Since Youtube is shutting down a lot of Discord Music bots (such as Rythm and Groovy), I figured it would be a good idea to write my own bot that can't be shut down.<br>
I currently use this bot on a few servers with my friends.

## Features
Right now DJ Luigi support a lot of the features bots like Rythm had
- Loading and Playing Music
- Queue Management (Clearing Queue, Skipping Songs, etc)
- DJ Permissions
- DJ Only Mode
- Editable Prefix
- Queue Looping

## Experimental Features
- Server Playlists

## Planned Features
There are a few features that I'd like to add
- Skip Command (Forceskip currently works, I just need to add a voteskip)
- Rework of the menu system

## Note
This is one of my first serious public projects. I'm still new to git and GitHub, and the code still needs a lot of documentation and formatting.
